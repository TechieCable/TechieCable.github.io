# TechieCable GitHub Website Project

This is the backend of TechieCable's website. If you got lost and actually want to see the website, [you can find it here](https://techiecable.github.io/).

I am a programmer in the making and after completing Khan Academy's Intro to HTML and CSS course, I decided to create a website. My original website was on [google sites](https://sites.google.com/view/techiecable), but I wanted a website that I could build from the ground up. So, I began creating this repository here on GitHub.
