			Hey! I'm Techie Cable, a learning programmer. Welcome to my website!<br><br>
			
			Currently, I am writing Processing JavaScript programs, simple HTML web pages, and spicing those web pages up with some CSS styling. I recently wrote a few programs centered around time. Let me explain:<br><br>
			
			Have you ever wondered exactly how many days it has been since your last birthday? The start of the year? <time>00/00/0000</time>? I <a href="programs\days_since">wrote a program that can calculate all of those</a>, and more. <s>Below you will see a program</s> that I wrote specifically to show how many days have passed since March 13, 2020, around when Coronavirus lockdowns started in some areas. It basically calculates how many days there were between <time>3/13/2020</time> and <time>00/00/0000</time>. Then it finds your current day and calculates the number of days between that and <time>00/00/0000</time>. Finally, it subtracts days since 3/13 from today and shows the viewer the output. <abbr title="No longer supported">I put it in a nice block of text for showing on the website.</abbr><br><br>
			
			You can view a <a href="programs">list of all my published programs</a> or see my <a href="programs\days_since">latest release</a> <s>(also shown just after this letter)</s>.<br><br>

			Hey! I'm Techie Cable, an actively learning programmer. Welcome to my website! Let me tell you a bit about myself.<br><br>
			
			As of now, I can write very basic JavaScript programs, simplistic HTML web pages, and a bit of CSS styling. I created my first program, <a href="program\click_counter">Click Speed Counter</a>, as an experiment to test my learning. While creating it, I developed a system for measuring time inside a JavaScript program. Now I can assign a variable for the start time, current time, remaining time, and elapsed time in a program. With this knowledge, I can make individual objects or text appear on the page after a specified amount of time. For example, in my second program, <a href="programs\space_invaders">Space Invaders</a>, the game has a five-second countdown from when you hit the start button to when you are redirected to play the game.<br><br>
			
			I hope to continue to learn more and practice my skills by posting fun games and useful utilities on this site. You can view <a href="programs">list of all my published programs</a> or see <a href="programs\space_invaders">my latest release</a> <s>(also shown just after this letter)</s>.<br><br>
